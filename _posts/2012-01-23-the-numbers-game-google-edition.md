Larry Page at last weeks Google [earnings call][1]:

> I'm also pleased to announce that there are over 90 million Google+ users, well over double what I announced just a quarter ago on our earnings call. Engagement on + is also growing tremendously. I have some amazing data to share there for the first time. + users are very engaged with our products. Over 60% of them engage daily and over 80% weekly.

Pretty impressive. What's missing? Any mention of the fact that creating a new Google account forces you to signup for Google+, existing account users can activate Google+ without realizing (or wanting) it, and all Google activity (Gmail, Docs, web search, etc) while signed in counts as Google+ 'engagement'. That's like Coca-Cola slipping their product into the water supply and then claiming over 100% increase in Coca-Cola drinkers, with the majority being 'very engaged'. Meaningless numbers. Looks like I'll have to update my definitions of *willing* and *participation*. Again.

I *can* get behind Larry Page on this one though:

> Android is, quite simply, mind-boggling.

Agreed.
