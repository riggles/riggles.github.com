From [ReadWriteWeb][1]:

> Having failed to carve out a place for itself in the post-PC era, Hewlett-Packard is now taking drastic measures â€” by adopting Google's Android operating system to run a series of upcoming mobile devices.

I'm puzzled. I understand Microsoft has been distancing some OEMs by making their own tablet and loaning Dell $2 billion to go private, but what will this move away from Windows accomplish? Android device sales are dominated by Samsung, at least in smartphones, who has to [spend billions on marketing][2] in order to do so. In tablets, the Google Nexus and Amazon Kindle lines rule the roost with Samsung following.

My question is, what makes HP think it can even compete in the Android market?
