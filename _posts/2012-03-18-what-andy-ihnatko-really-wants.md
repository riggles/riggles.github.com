I expected something a little better:

> What if OS X 11 had a separate Easy Mode in which the user is always looking at a single screen of immediately-relevant tiles […]?

You mean, like the Windows 8&nbsp;[Metro UI][1]?

> I want my Dock icons to stop bouncing.

Just [tell them too][2]. *Google is your friend.*

> I want Screen Sharing to work between my iPad and my iMac.

There’s [an app][3] for that. Unless, of course, you want to control your iPad from your iMac. That makes me scratch my head. I always thought it was easier to control your iPad from your iPad. If all he wants is to see his iPad on a bigger screen, 10.8 Mountain Lion has screen sharing to a TV over AirPlay.

So, what is it that you really want?
