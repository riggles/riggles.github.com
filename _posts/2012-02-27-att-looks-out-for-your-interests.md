AT&T revealed that it has plans in the works to allow app developers to pay for their apps data usage. Sounds well enough on the surface but, this being AT&T, is largely self-serving. For one, this doesn’t lower your data bill unless that app was making you go over your monthly data limit (read: you still get to pay them in full). But besides that, let me see if I have this straight:

1.  AT&T requires an unlimited data plan for smartphones.
2.  Smartphone sales take off.
3.  AT&T replaces unlimited data with capped data plans.
4.  A handful of customers go over their data limit.
5.  AT&T lets app makers pay extra so you don’t go over your data cap.

How magnanimous. Of course, if app makers have learned anything from AT&T, that extra cost will find it’s way to consumers wallets. Excellent. I look forward to paying more for apps that don’t use up the data plan AT&T requires me to have, so I don’t go over the limit they imposed on me, which I don’t go over anyway. You stay classy AT&T.
