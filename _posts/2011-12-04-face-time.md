Dominique Browning woes the arduousness of face-to-face communication—a rare stranger in these parts—in an [op-ed piece][1] for the New York Times.

> Seeing faces burdens us with responsibilities we may be too weary to shoulder. I've gotten used to not having to deal with everything that gets dragged in behind those voices, smiles and laughs. Things like the wince in the forehead, when you've been too sharp. Or the shadow across the eyes when you've hurt a feeling.

Translation: I can't care about me *and* you, and I pick me.

So sad.
