There’s something kind of wonderful about [this little printer][1]. Just watch its intro video and tell me you don’t want to take one home. For those who still love the feel of holding a vinyl record, paper book, or slide film, this might be right up your alley. Irony: using a smartphone to choose the online content you want printed in your mini-newspaper.
