title: 'What time is it?'

This is a question that never goes out of style. What does go out of style is being *told* what time it is. Now the trick is to actually remove it from style.

I saw this clearly while I visited my parents over the weekend. Sunday morning, as I walked into the kitchen, I was greeted with five different devices answering the question I had not yet asked. There was the digital clock on the stove, the microwave, the coffee maker, the toaster oven, and that other small kitchen appliance that I can't remember what it does but it must have looked impressive on TV. Was I curious about the time? No, and yet there was the answer everywhere I turned. I didn't feel like Captain Hook — it wasn't like a bad dream, but more like an annoying one.

Why does every kitchen appliance need a clock? Does Mr. Coffee think there's a real lack of time-telling devices in this room? Was this a hole that needed filling? I submit that it was not.

What do kitchens have by default, since day one? A stove. Stoves have a clock built in. Need to know what time it is? Look at the stove. And it makes sense — stoves are already displaying timers and other digit-based information. The same goes with a microwave. So we have two digital clocks. I'd love to be able to turn them off and look at a wall clock instead, but fine. Now enters the toaster oven and coffee maker who want to hang with the cool kids — and here we are.

I'd like to see more household products taken down to their essentials, both in functionality and aesthetics. Are you a toaster oven? Just toast. Coffee maker? Just make the coffee. The best industrial designs are often so simple in presentation. Take [Dieter Rams][1] for example and his design principles. More of this please. Leave the time telling to well designed clocks. That's what they do.
