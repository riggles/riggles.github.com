MG Siegler on recent Microsoft Office for iPad clatter:

> What if Microsoft is planning to do Office for tablets as an exclusive for the iPad (until the Windows 8 tablets come out, of course), while totally shafting Android? Wouldn't such a move be worthy of an announcement on stage at an Apple event which also happens to be all about tablets? I think so.

[John Gruber][1] doesn’t think it’ll happen, and it’s hard to see Apple using it’s measured special event time to invite Microsoft onstage. But part of me would get a huge kick out of it actually happening. Not because of the Google factor, but because of the history of these two companies.

Before there was Windows, Microsoft made more money selling Word for Apple computers then their own MS-DOS platform. Then came Windows and everything changed. 20 years later PC sales (also known as Windows sales) are way down, [Office sales are strong][2], and the iPad is the hottest game in town. If the Office suite came to the iPad, I think it would be immensely successful and could bring Microsoft full circle to their beginning — making lot’s of money for Apple’s platform.
