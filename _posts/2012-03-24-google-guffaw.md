Jeffrey Zeldman [gets an email from Google][1]:

> So Google wrote to my zeldman.com address, which they won't allow me to associate with my Google+ address, to invite me to start a Google+ account (which I already have) on my zeldman.com account, which they won't support. And if I do that (which I can't), and some other complicated stuff, they promise that I will then be able to participate in Google IO, whatever that is.

Google direct marketing FTW!
