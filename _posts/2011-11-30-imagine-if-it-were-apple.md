John Gruber comments on reactions to the unsettling amount of information being secretly logged on most modern Android, BlackBerry, and Nokia phones by Carrier IQ.

> The problem isn't that the news media aren't sensationalizing this Carrier IQ story. The problem is that they would if it involved Apple.

Remember the hubbub around reports of a ‘flawed’ iPhone 4 antenna design and its signal strength reducing ‘death grip’? Sure. But recall the followup stories revealing that many other smartphones can show similar behavior—some manufacturers even saying so in the product manual? No. Why? First, because the news media never got around to the followups, and second, because exposés don’t get page views unless they’re about Apple.
