Google CEO Eric Schmidt, speaking at the LeWeb conference in Paris:

> Whether you like Android or not, you will support that platform.

Oh really? Darn it, I sure wish I had a choice in the m… oh wait, I do. And so do all the developers that have become highly successful developing only for iOS. What would you rather develop for: a platform that has more devices sold but whose users are statistically shown to spend little money on apps, or the platform who's tens of millions of users fall over themselves to buy apps? 'Follow the money'.

But Mr. Schmidt argued that instead of Android users waiting for iOS apps to be ported to Android,“my prediction is that six months from now you'll say the opposite”.

Also, I agree with [Marco Arment][1] that Google should not let this guy speak on stage, if this is what he has to offer.
