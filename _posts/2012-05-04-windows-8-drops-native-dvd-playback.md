Microsoft’s [Building Windows 8][1] blog:

> Windows Media Player will continue to be available in all editions, but without DVD playback support. For optical discs playback on new Windows 8 devices, we are going to rely on the many quality solutions on the market, which provide great experiences for both DVD and Blu-ray.

My knee-jerk reaction was, “Are they serious?!”, but after re-reading the post and thinking about it, this move makes a lot of sense. Remember, they’re not saying you can’t play DVDs on Windows 8, it’s just that Windows Media Player (WMP) will not. Since PCs that come with optical drives also come bundled with 3rd party playback software, the vast majority of people aren’t using WMP for DVDs anyway. On top of that, according to their research (and my experience), most people are not playing DVDs on their computer at all — it’s streaming and downloads. So why keep paying for that feature, especially for ultrabooks which don’t even have an optical drive. The real question is, will this make Windows 8 any less expensive? Will the cost savings be passed onto the consumer? That would be nice.
