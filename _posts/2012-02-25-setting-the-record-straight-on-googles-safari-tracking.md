The researchers who first uncovered that Google circumvents Safari’s default privacy setting for cookies clears up some confusion. I’ll highlight just two.

Some of this confusion comes from [Google’s claim][1] that it was trying to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled. Only one problem:

> The circumvention behaviors affected all users, independent of whether they had a Google account, were logged into a Google account, or had made a choice about social advertising.

Google also stated that, unlike other major browsers, Safari blocks third-party cookies by default — and last year Google started going around it. History shows this:

> The default cookie blocking feature that Google circumvented was implemented in Safari 1.0, which shipped in 2003—long before Google was in the third-party display advertising business, and long before relations between the companies soured over smartphones.

Hmm, so Google was okay respecting Safari’s privacy settings from 2003 all the way until 2011. Interesting. Hey, you know else happened in 2011? Google launched their social-networking service.
