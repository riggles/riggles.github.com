Remember that link I posted about [Windows on the iPad][1]? It seems the service, [OnLive Desktop][2], has caught the attention of Microsoft—and not in a good way. Corporate VP of licensing, Joe Matz:

> We are actively engaged with OnLive with the hope of bringing them into a properly licensed scenario, and we are committed to seeing this issue is resolved.

Sounds like they’ll make them an offer they can’t refuse.
