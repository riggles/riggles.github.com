It seems like every tech news post about the movie industry, the music industry, or even on Internet privacy is reduced to an argument about piracy in the comments section. I find this a little fascinating — mostly because of the arguments being made. They range from, “Pirating music gives artists wider exposure to potential buyers” to, “That TV series won't be available to buy for months, or won't ever be available in my country” to, “These studios are scumbags. I'm not giving them my money.”

Such arguments contain a lot of truth. Peer-to-peer file sharing has introduced many users to bands they might never have heard of. Lots of TV shows are limited in the number of countries they're available in and it may take a year for a show to go on sale in eligible countries. The RIAA and MPAA do indeed act in scummy fashions. Here's the thing: all of these are true, yet none of them make piracy any less illegal.

[Andy Ihnatko][1] wrote something on this subject that, in my opinion, really hits the nail on the head:

It's that sense of entitlement that's at the core here, whether smug or not. Because someone *wants* something they have the right to have it. This simply is not the case. We don't get to have everything we want when we want it. Common sense tells you that. Life should tell you that. I learned this as a small child. But so many seem to have forgotten it. Combine that with a healthy dose of rationalizing and we have a community of piracy advocates who see illegal downloading as their only option — because not having something is no option at all.

So silly. It really is. Some people argue on the topic to such a level that you'd think they were being denied inalienable human rights. But really, it's just a television show. It's not available for digital download until next year? Wait till next year. Have to buy a cable subscription to watch this new series? Buy the subscription or don't watch it. Unhappy with studio pricing and distribution models? Don't buy their products and tell them why!

Just don't pirate and then tell me it was the only option.
