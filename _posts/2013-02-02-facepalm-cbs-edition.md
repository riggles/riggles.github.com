CBS is on a roll and not a good oneâ€”more like a string of Lance Armstrong's blood tests kind-of-roll. The latest is their banning of a SodaStream commercial from the Super Bowl. [Will Burns, for Forbes][1]:

> CBS banned SodaStream's Super Bowl spot because, apparently, it was too much of a direct hit to two of its biggest sponsors, Coke and Pepsi.
>
> Please pause and read that sentence again.

This, just weeks after forcing its CNET staff to [disqualify the Dish Hopper DVR][2] from being Best In Show at CES, even though it had already been voted as such, because CBS is suing them, then banning CNET from [reviewing it at all][3], and finally having the Consumer Electronics Association drop CNET as the selector of the CES Best In Show award in response.

They're doing it to themselves.
