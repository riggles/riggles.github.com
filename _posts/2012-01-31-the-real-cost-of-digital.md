In my last post I talked about the loss of connection between myself and photography when I switched from shooting film to digitally. I didn't know this would happen, but I've comforted myself with idea that my hobby has become more efficient and less expensive. That was until I found [Ken Rockwell's article][1] which called that thought into question.

For most people, including myself, comparing the cost of film and digital quickly ends with the thought of not having to buy film anymore or pay for processing. Bam! I'm saving money already. But is it that simple? Or is it more like those coupons you get in the mail that let you save $10 off your next purchase of $100 or more? Are you saving $10, or just spending $90 that you wouldn't have otherwise? I thought I'd give a closer look to the actual costs of moving to digital photography[^digital]. What do we money on?

### Initial Investment

The first thing you have to do is buy your digital replacement. This can be an expensive proposition. I'm going to use Canon as a baseline because all of the people I know who have recently gotten into photography have gotten Canon DSLRs. A common entry point is a T3i w/ 18-55mm lens for $712 (as of this writing) at B&H Photo. Feeling like more of an advanced amateur? The 60D and 7D w/ kit lenses can be had for $1,200 or $1,600 respectively. Most people don't jump into digital higher than this price point. If they do, the cost of switching probably isn't a big concern. Add the cost of typical DSLR accessories that you may not own (ie: extra battery, memory cards, UV filter for your new lens, etc.) and you can quickly add $150 to your purchase. If you have an existing film SLR, you could avoid buying a lens, but you will have to buy a more expensive body that excepts them, as the lesser expensive bodies except digital-only lenses.

‘What about buying used?’, you may ask. I highly recommend it. The only problem is that many don't consider this when they first start. I didn't. It felt like buying a used TV or PC. Why would you buy something that's already out-of-date? I didn't know this to be faulty thinking until much later, so I bought new. Since then I've advised many other people to buy used and save money — they've bought new as well. So I'm using new prices in my comparison.

### Repeating Investment

This money-saving switch now has a price-tag of almost $1,000 w/ tax. We think this is the last time we'll be spending money on this hobby, but it won't. Why? For the same reason we bought new — we consider this device to be in the same category as computers and smartphones. They all have upgrade cycles. DSLRs with new features and higher megapixel counts are released regularly and it's hard not to be persuaded to upgrade every 3-5 years. Ask anyone whose been shooting for a while how upgrade-itis has effected them. I started with a Canon D60, then moved to a 10D, then a Nikon D60, and finally a Nikon D5000. I lost money every time (this is one reason why I advise buying used).

Upgrading the camera isn't the only repeat investment. These digital photos need to go somewhere. If you're shooting RAW, space adds up quickly, especially as your megapixels increase. Also, you're not just paying for storage space, you're paying for archiving. Film is physically archived by nature and additionally by optical disc is you have it scanned when processing. Not so with digital and hard drives have shelf lives. If you don't want to loose your photos, you back them up and then replace the hard drive every few years before they fail — because fail they will.

### The Cost of Film

I read an article recently where the writer used his digital picture-taking figures to price how much that would cost in film and processing. That may make sense to someone that began with digital, but to those of us who began with film, we know those figures are way off. Reason being, you take far fewer pictures with film. You don't want to waste it on needless bracketing or 'just in case I'll shoot it from all angles and with different exposures' shots. You're more selective because you just paid for this film and, after you're done, you'll pay to process it — you make the frames count. With digital, you paid for it all up front so shoot as much as you want. Shoot 1,000 frames, 1,000,000! Just don't think you saved $1,000,000 in film.

So how many pictures would you take with film? That's a tough question. I wish I was paying more attention when I first started. But by brief comparison, my friend just went on a cross-country trip for three weeks. He shot less than 200 frames of film. When I took a slightly shorter cross-country trip I took over 1,200 digital frames. Our top pick of photos, however, were about the same. He shot over 85% fewer frames and got just as many keepers, even though I've been shooting much longer. I know this is highly subjective, but it's simply to illustrate this: you use much less film to get a similar result.

How many dollars does this translate to? Well, it depends on how much film you need. If you're a hobbyist that would shoot 5,000 frames per year in digital, you may only need 20-25 rolls of film. B&H has Kodak Ektar for $5/roll, so let's say you spend $125 on film per year. Processing is about the same cost per roll, so double that figure and you're at $250/year to pay for your film habit — give or take. Sounds expensive. But consider that, in the digital world, you paid over $1,000 to take pictures for the next, say, five years before upgrading and spending possibly another $1,000. That's over $200/year and you're paying up front. If you don't have the cash, you're also paying finance charges on your credit card. Want to upgrade in three years? You've just spent almost $350/year. Want to upgrade to a more professional camera this time? Your cost per year also goes up. These are real factors in digital photography and it puts the costs of both into perspective.

### Intangible Costs

There can be other 'costs' to a digital system. It may seem silly, but how about packing simplicity when traveling? With film, the only thing outside of your camera you need to bring is a handful of film canisters. No extra batteries (they last for years), no battery charger, no extra memory cards, no card reader, no laptop, and no laptop charger required. Simplicity can be nice. So can evenings spent enjoying your new scenery instead of importing and sifting through the 500 images you took that day.

Even less tangible is the lost feeling (no pun intended). As I discovered after I switched, there was less connection. No film to touch. Less time spent making photographs. Less time looking at the scene. Less time considering lighting and composition. This time practicing the craft has been replaced by time spent reviewing captures on the back of my camera. With my face glued to the screen, I'm missing photo opportunities. I'm just retaking photos that didn't turn out the way I wanted until they look right, instead of developing gut instincts for exposures. I don't know if I can put a dollar value on that, but I feel as though something has been lost.

### All Tolled

Looking at my own shooting habits over the years, I believe I've paid more for my digital lifestyle than I would have with film (film and processing used to be cheaper). If you shoot considerably more than me or shoot for news or sports, roles start to reverse. But even if I broke even, it definitely wasn't cheaper like I justified to myself when switching. There is an undeniable immediacy that digital photography brings to me — and also a price.
