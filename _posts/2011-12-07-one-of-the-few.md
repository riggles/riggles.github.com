Just following up on the Motorola Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade. Their release also includes the devices they are planning on upgrading. There are four. I know that's not a complete list yet, but still … *four*? That made me curious how many different Android devices Motorola has released. A quick trip to Wikipedia and you can [see a list][1] of 19 phones and 1 tablet (not including alternate versions released overseas) since 2009. Of those, four are planned for ICS upgrades — assuming both lists are complete. That's a paltry 20%.

As a comparison, since 2009, Apple has released seven devices and only one is not upgradable to the lastest iOS 5, the iPod Touch (3G). That's 86%. In fact, over half of all the iOS devices ever released since the original iPhone in 2007 can run the lastest OS.

So if you get to upgrade to ice cream and cookie deliciousness, count yourself special. If not, well, not everybody can be special in the ‘open’ world I guess.
