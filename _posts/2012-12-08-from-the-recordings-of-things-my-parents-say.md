Dad: | What do you think of this tie?
Me: | It looks like the kind of tie I might have worn in the past mixed with the kind of tie you currently wear.
Dad: | It goes with both black and brown.
Me: | Two colors that typically shouldn't be put together.
Dad: | Yea, but with this tie you can.
Me: | Can? Yes. Should?
Dad: | And it only cost me $5!
