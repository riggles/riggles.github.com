The Macalope comments on Bill Snyder’s [solution][1] to the labor concerns in China by boycotting Apple.

>> Until Apple convinces me it is doing everything it can to markedly improve those conditions, I won't buy either [a new iPhone or a new iPad] , at any price. How about you?
> 
> So, is Snyder going to buy a competitor's product instead? One sold by a company with a worse record on pressuring its Chinese suppliers? Does that make any sense? If he's just going to take up Luddism, though, more power to him. Or, well, less, as the case may be.

I guess Mr. Snyder’s concern with human working conditions began *after* he bought his current iPhone and iPad, and doesn’t include how his home appliances or clothing are made.
