It seems Google's WebM “open standard” video * format is getting some unwanted * attention; this * time from the MPEG LA. From [The Verge][1] (emphasis added):

> When the WebM project was announced back in 2010, one (of) its selling points was that it was open and free of the licensing needs imposed by competitors like H.264. _That may have been slightly overstated_, however, as Google and MPEG LA have just entered into a licensing agreement covering the video codec at the heart of the format.

I think the words they were searching for are: *Totally bogus*.
