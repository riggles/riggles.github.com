Brian Chen for *The New York Times*, quoting the cable providers CEO Glen Brit:

> “I'm not sure I know what AirPlay is.”

This, after saying that digital video's challenge is lack of a simple way to get Internet-based video onto TVs. Ironically, he comments on how easy it is to get Internet video on an iPad. So close and yet so far away.

Almost as good is his follow-up:

> “So the current Apple TV, the little thing, the hockey puck, really doesn't do anything to help enable you to get Internet material on your TV.”

I hope he's just trying to downplay any possible competition from Apple because, if this is his honest-to-goodness evaluation, yikes.
