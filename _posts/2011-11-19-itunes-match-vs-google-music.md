Apple and Google have launched their online music libraries on the heal of one another. While Google Music is also a store for purchasing music, new for Google, how do their cloud services match up?

For one, there is the price. iTunes Match costs $25/year, whereas Google Music costs $0/year. But that doesn’t mean that Google Music is free. As with all services from Google, the cost is your personal information, which Google sells to advertisers. The dollar value you assign your information is up to you.

Each service has their own advantages. iTunes has a larger music catalog. Google offers a web-based player. iTunes will upgrade your low bit-rate songs and maybe [save you lots of money][1]. Google actually streams your music files and doesn’t download them to your device until you choose to. iTunes has a higher 25,000 track limit and doesn’t upload files unless they can’t be matched. Also, multiple devices can be using iTunes Match simultaneously. Which features are most important depends on you.

Some users have found that iTunes Match and Google Music actually work well as a pair. Both services are a good offering for consumers and music lovers alike.
