Australian Police warn motorists about using iOS Maps. Trevor Mogg for Digital Trends:

> Victoria police said on Monday that in the last two months they've had to rescue six people lost in Murray-Sunset National Park after they tried to use Apple's troubled map app to locate the city of Mildura. While Maps shows it to be located inside the park, it's actually situated 43 miles (70km) away.
> 
> â€¦Some of the motorists located by police have been stranded for up to 24 hours without food or water and have walked long distances through dangerous terrain to get phone reception.

What a mess. Of course, Police officials could also have implored travelers to use some common sense if their directions take them from a highway to a dirt path.
