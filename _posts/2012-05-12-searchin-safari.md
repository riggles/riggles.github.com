Yesterday, [John Gruber wrote][1] about the low-hanging fruit of iOS 6 — must-have features that are missing which Apple is undoubtedly working on. His list was pretty short. My request is comparatively simple. Heck, it could be included in an incremental upgrade. I would like searching in Mobile Safari to be more like searching with [m.bing.com][2]. Specifically, the ability to string together search suggestions before submitting the search.

What am I talking about? Here's an example from just last week. I wanted to search for Radiohead's *King of Limbs* album on vinyl with the iPhone. I open Mobile Safari, tap in the search box, and proceed to type 'radiohead king of limbs v' before the correct phrase comes up on the list of search suggestions. Me wanting to be efficient but also being lazy, I would much prefer not to do all of that typing.

Here's what the experience is like if, instead of using Mobile Safari's built-in search, I use Bing's mobile search site. In the search field I type 'radioh' and the top suggestion is Radiohead. Nothing new there. The difference is that next to the suggestions are '%2B' symbols that enable you to add that suggestion to your search field.

![Tap ‘+’ to add Radiohead][3]
Now that Radiohead is in the search field, all future suggestions will be relative to Radiohead. So I type 'k' and the top suggestion is King of Limbs. Perfect.

![Adding ‘King of Limbs’][4]
Repeat this with the letter 'v', vinyl is suggested, and my search phrase is complete. I can now search for 'radiohead king of limbs vinyl' but only having typed 'radioh k v'. Much cleaner, must faster.

I include this in the category of missing features (as opposed to a competitors feature I wish I had) because the ability to string together search suggestions already exists in Safari for Mac. It has for a while. In addition, I would argue that streamlining mobile search is quite important. When I open Safari on the iPhone, 4/5 times it's to search for something. I would think that, with the millions of iPhone and iPad users, a hefty percentage of Mobile Safari use is begun with a search. It only makes sense that Apple design the friendliest way possible to perform such searches.
