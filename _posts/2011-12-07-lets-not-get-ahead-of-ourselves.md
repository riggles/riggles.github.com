Eric Schmidt was in quite the positive mood in Paris this week. So much so that one could think he took something 'to help calm down' before taking the stage. But despite his eagerness to declare Google out in front on mobile and home TV apps, he may have gone a little Wile E. Coyote.

First, hot on the heels of Mr. Schmidt's citing Android 4.0 'Ice Cream Sandwich' release as a driving force behind their future leading of the mobile app marketplace, Motorola [issued a release][1] regarding the ICS upgrade process. It's not encouraging.

> We are currently assessing this source code, and over the next month we will be determining which devices will get the upgrade and when. … From there, the following steps take place:

There are four basic steps, including: adapting for different hardware architectures, stabilizing and working out the bugs, submitting for certification, pre-release testing, and then the public release. So after the first month of deciding who gets what and when, the real work begins. Bottom line: it's gonna be awhile. Also, today Sony Ericsson also [released an outline][2] of ICS upgrade availability. Same deal, 'it's lots of work so get excited but don't hold your breath'.

So Google declares a pre-victory in six months when there's currently only one device even shipping with ICS, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and now manufacturers are making it clear it'll be months until millions of existing devices can upgrade. Perhaps that would have been good to know before taking the stage.

The Google CEO also declared victory in the TV business, which is a surprise considering how poorly their attempts [have been received][3]. But maybe he knows something we don't. Surely he must to say:

> By the summer of 2012, the majority of the televisions you see in stores will have Google TV embedded.

Wow. That's pretty good, because right now *none* of the TVs we see in stores have Google TV embedded. And while being “in stores” is good, it's not the same as “in homes”. You know what else there were a lot of “in stores”? The [RIM PlayBook][4].

Looks like Google's going to have a busy six months. Thanks to Eric Schmidt, they have some catching up to do.
