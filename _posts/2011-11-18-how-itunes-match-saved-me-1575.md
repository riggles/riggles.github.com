I have always wished I could carry my whole music collection on my 32GB iPhone 4, but considering my library is teetering on 100GB, that’s not gonna happen by traditional syncing means. I’ve also tried Spotify’s premium service for use of their iOS app, but at $10/month, I didn’t think it was worth it for not owning any music in the end. Enter iTunes Match, launched this week by Apple. Since I had roughly $40 of store credit in my iTunes account, I decided to give it a whirl.

Besides making my whole music library available on my iPhone, one of the other reasons I wanted to try this service is that iTunes Match will play back matched low (down to 96Kbs) bit-rate songs with their 256Kbs AAC equivalents. What I didn’t realize, though, is that you can use this feature to upgrade your actual low bit-rate files. Permanently. This includes your CD rips, old iTunes DRM-locked files, and dubious downloads. Sweet!

When I first switched to digital download only, back in 2003, I didn’t care much about bit-rates. So a number of my songs are 128Kbs, about 6,000 of them. They’re a combination of CD rips and lots of locked iTunes downloads. Since then, I’ve begun to enjoy listening to the sound quality improvement of higher bit-rate songs. But to upgrade all these songs, you basically have two options: find the old CDs (if you still can) and re-rip them, or pay $0.30/track for all your locked files to be upgraded by the iTunes Store. That’s a lot of time and, more importantly, money.

Let’s say, for argument sake (since I’d have to repurchase CDs I’ve lost, sold, or damaged) that all my 6,000 songs were of the locked iTunes download variety. At $0.30 a pop, that’s $1,600. No thanks. I’d rather buy, you know, lots of other things. But with iTunes Match and this [handy-dandy MacWorld guide][1], I was able to replace all 6,000 files for the low cost of $25. So, in my book, I saved $1,575 - give or take. That’s worth the price of admission right there.
