John Gruber, commenting on articles popping up that already downplay the (yet unannounced) new iPad:

> But if a faster processor, more RAM, a double-the-resolution retina display, a better camera, and maybe even LTE networking make for a “modest” update, then what would it take for the iPad 3 to be deemed an immodest update? A fusion energy source? Teleportation? A camera that sees into the future?

Seriously, what would it take to blow some of these tech journalists away? My guess, nothing. As MG Siegler [puts it][2]:

> Being pre-disappointed is the new disappointed.

It’s a mindset — hard to impress that.
