If you haven’t heard about Mike Daisey’s fabrication of facts regarding his visit to Foxconn factories in China, I recommend listening to this retraction episode of [*This American Life*][1]—who unknowingly aired his story as fact. On the program are *TAL* host Ira Glass, Mike Daisey himself, his translator in China, and journalist Rob Schmitz who uncovered the lies behind Mike Daisey’s story.

If I had to pick one sentence (which is a tough call), it would be this one as Mr. Daisey responds to whether his word can be trusted:

> I think you can trust my word in the context of the theater.

Translation: Only in a world where truth and lie have no meaning.
