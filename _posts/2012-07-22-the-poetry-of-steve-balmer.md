[This piece from Asymco][1] collects just a sample of the Microsoft CEO's unique speaking style as he comments on iPad and iPhone competition. I'll translate a few excerpts for those who don't speak blundering idiot:

> Today, kind of I'd say one of the top issues on my mind, let alone on your minds, one of the top issues on my mind, is, hey, there is a category that we've had Windows on for actually a long time.

“You must be wondering why we still haven't brought a Windows tablet to market after all these years. We think about that, too.”

> We're coming full guns. The operating system is called Windows. No — there's — let me be unambiguous. A new Windows Phone for screen sizes that, let me just say, are, you know, sort of bigger than three or four inches — the answer is Windows Phone.

“Let's be clear about one thing. We've at least figured out the name we want to use. I think. Ok, well, it's gonna have the word Windows in it, that's for darn sure.”

> We've got work we have to do with hardware partners, with Intel. There's certainly some work to be done there. And over time where we go is where we go. But at least in the timeframe that which anybody does these models, for example, let's go. Let's go and we'll be in market as soon as we can with new devices, whether that's, you know, really, really soon or just really pretty soon.

“We've got so much work to do it's not even funny. It would be awesome if we were done soon but, honestly, we have no idea.”

> We've been competing with Macs, and I notice in this audience you get one profile for the 93 percent of people almost who agree with us every day about laptops. We're going to have things that should be interesting to them. That doesn't mean it's not going to be exciting. That doesn't mean you're not going to have to pay attention to shareholders. It certainly means we've got to pay attention. But, at the end of the day kind of what makes life kind of interesting, kind of fun, and you're going to see very interesting things.

“I'm just gonna start spitballing here and throw words together. Hopefully they form sentences until my time is up.”

Did Yogi Berra write a book on public speaking that I missed?
