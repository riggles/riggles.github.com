Not iPad 3. Not iPad HD. The new iPad. Simple. The numbering game is a tricky one. Where would it end? Apple iPad 5S HD Mark IV (I’m looking at you Canon)? No thanks. Funny thing is, this doesn’t happen with computers. What computer do I use? MacBook Pro. That’s it — no one asks if it’s the late-2011, early-2011, or mid-2010 model. It’s just a MacBook Pro.

I’ve always wondered how much time and energy goes into deciding what extension goes on the end of a product. Apple no longer worries about this. I see the next iPhone following in like manner. I can also see this becoming a trend with other companies. Apple broke the ice. This may pose a small headache for accessory makers in the future, though. It’d be much easier for them to market (and consumers to buy) a case for an iPad 3 or 4 than ‘last years new iPad’ or ‘this years new iPad’.
