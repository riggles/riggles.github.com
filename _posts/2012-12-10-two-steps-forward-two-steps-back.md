[Ars Technica reviews][1] the new entry-level 21.5" iMac. Steps forward: new enclosure is lighter, quieter, and runs coolers than its predecessor. Steps backward: only leaves room for slower 2.5" hard drives, worse speakers, and no user upgradeable anything. That is, unless you don’t mind getting hosed at order time.

> The 21.5-inch iMac can be upgraded to 16GB of RAM at purchase for $200; 16GB of RAM in two 8GB DIMMs costs about $60 on the open market.
>
> It's just sad to see that, even in a desktop computer, we're entering an age of hyper-inflated, OEM-defined RAM prices that end users can’t choose to fight by purchasing their own upgrades.

It’s not just RAM either. Want the new hard drive performance hit to go away?

> It will also completely disappear if you opt to add a Fusion Drive to your new iMac, which sounds like a no-brainer until you consider that you’ll be paying $450 for the upgrade—$200 to pay for the high-end 21.5-inch configuration and $250 more for the 128GB SSD itself.
>
> All of this is to say the cheapest iMac you can buy with a solid-state drive of any kind on board costs $1,749 before tax. This is a world where the MacBook Air starts at $999 and includes standard SSDs across the line.

I've always upheld that iMacs are the best Mac value around. I'm struggling to say this now.
