With Facebook being valued at $100 billion and set to go public, Nick Bilton in the *New York Times* Bits Blog [puts his hand out][1]:

> So all this leaves me with a question: Where's my cut? I helped build this thing, too. Facebook laid the foundation of the house and put in the plumbing, but we put up the walls, picked out the furniture, painted and hung photos, and invited everyone over for dinner parties.

Let's move past the fact that Mr. Bilton knew he wasn't getting paid when he signed up. Realistically, I think his contribution begins and ends at inviting everyone over for dinner parties. I think a more accurate analogy is this: Facebook has built a time-share and let you and your friends crash there. The only catch is that there's a camera in every room. You get to stay for free and they get to keep the tapes.

> I for one would feel more comfortable with Facebook looking through my phonebook, wallet and underwear drawer if I knew I was going to get paid for it.

I, for one, would feel more comfortable if I knew no one was looking through my phonebook, wallet and underwear drawer. (Also, you knew you weren't getting paid for it.)
