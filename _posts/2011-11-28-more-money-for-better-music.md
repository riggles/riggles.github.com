Since the news of some record labels [pulling their music][1] from streaming services like Spotify, I’ve been thinking more about this ‘revenue vs. the-future-of-music’ thing. Let’s be honest, streaming music is a tide that cannot be held back. It is here to stay—and expand. But it doesn’t take a math degree to figure out that music streaming revenue isn’t the same as music sales. How *can* it be? When people can now pay $5-$10/month and stream almost any song or album they want, who wants to pay $1/song or $10/album with downloads? Not as many as there used to be.

So many have wifi or 3/4G access all day that they don’t have to own music files to listen to them whenever they want. I still enjoy owning my music (be it digital file or vinyl record). I only pay for computer access, not mobile, and I like being able to put my on any device I please. So if there’s an album I really like, I buy it. Or if it’s only $5 on Amazon and it’s pretty good, I get it. But I listen to everything first on Spotify to measure it’s worth. This is how streaming music is changing the game—and scaring the crap out of the music industry.

Music is no longer being graded on a curve. It used to cost you $10 to find out your new favorite bands sophomore effort is a dud—the same amount of money it took to see your “old” favorite bands 6th release is brilliant. By that time the record label got all the money it planned on getting from you, regardless of how much you liked the music. But streaming services pay labels on a per-track-play basis. So, record labels get paid by what we actually listen to. What does that mean for revenue?

Let’s illustrate: Say you just bought those two albums from your favorite bands. It cost you $20. One you listen to all the time—the other, just that once. The record label doesn’t care because you bought the albums. But in the streaming world, not listening costs them—or should I say, deprives them of revenue.

So, in theory, “good” music pays more while “lame” music pays less. Record labels are not used to this at all and, understandably, don’t like it. Therefore, after seeing drops in revenue, some are pulling their artists music from streaming services in an effort to force people to buy. But is streaming really to blame? Or has the music industry been insulated for so long that the thought of earning money based on the quality and creativity of its music is exposing and shocking?

Don’t get me wrong, I believe good music will always earn money. But there’s a difference between getting someone to buy something and getting them to use it. Now that record labels aren’t getting paid by what consumers buy, but rather what they actually listen to, a new paradigm appears.
